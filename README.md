Hi there, Iâ€™m Ryan ðŸ‘‹

Hobbyist coder and tinkerer.

You'll usually find me playing with Python or JavaScript and its cousins (Node.js mainly), or running through courses online to expand my knowledge.
The Cloud is something I'm very interested in at the moment, and I have been completing courses online for AWS and Azure - an exciting world indeed!

For work, I'm based in the world of IT Security, specifically SAP.

Using this space to keep a repository of little projects I have made in my spare time.

Ryan.
