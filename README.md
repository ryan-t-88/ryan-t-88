Hi there, Iâ€™m Ryan ðŸ‘‹

Hobbyist coder and tinkerer.

You'll usually find me playing with Python or JavaScript (Node.js mainly), or running through courses online to expand my knowledge. I've
dipped my toes into web development (including HTML, CSS, Django, and Ruby on Rails), iOS/Android development, as well as messing around 
with automation, Raspberry Pi's, and the IoT. The Cloud is something I'm very interested in at the moment, and I have been completing courses online 
for AWS and Azure - an exciting world indeed!

For work, I'm based in the world of IT Security, specifically SAP.

Just using this space to keep a repository of little projects I have made in my spare time - feel free to have a look around!

Ryan.
